# 2D-Platformer-Test-Unity-
Testing physics in Unity 

The code is in C#.

This is my first Unity's project so all the steps are commented,
pretending to be as clear as posible, trying not to forget what I'm doing.

At the moment there are just the Player's basic movements and basic camera's behaviour. 
In Unity, the code must be complemented with basic sprites(player, ground, etc).
